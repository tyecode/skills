# Skill: release

## When to Use This Skill
Use this skill when the user runs the command `/release <version>` or asks to "cut the release for v<version>".

## Workflow Instructions

When invoked, the AI must sequentially execute these steps:

### 1. Determine Version

**If the user provided a version:** strip any leading `v` and use it. Skip to Step 2.

**If no version was provided:** suggest one based on commits since the last tag.

Get the last tag and commits:
```bash
git tag --sort=-v:refname | head -n 1
git log <PREVIOUS_TAG>..HEAD --oneline
# If no tags exist:
git log --oneline
```

Read the current version from `package.json` if it exists. If the project has no `package.json` (e.g. Python, Go, Rust), ask the user what the current version is. Then apply semver rules to the commits:

| Commit contains | Bump type | Example: `1.2.3` → |
|----------------|-----------|---------------------|
| `BREAKING CHANGE` or `!` after type (e.g. `feat!:`) | **major** | `2.0.0` |
| `feat:` | **minor** | `1.3.0` |
| `fix:`, `perf:`, `refactor:`, or anything else | **patch** | `1.2.4` |

If multiple rules match, use the highest bump. Present the suggestion to the user:
> "Based on your commits, this looks like a **minor** release. Suggested version: **1.3.0**. Confirm or enter a different version."

Wait for confirmation before proceeding.

### 2. Check for Unreleased Content
- Read `CHANGELOG.md` and check whether `## [Unreleased]` has any entries.
- If it is empty, warn the user: "No unreleased changes found in CHANGELOG.md. Run `/changelog` first to generate release notes."
- Stop and wait for the user to confirm they want to proceed anyway, or run `/changelog` first.

### 3. Stamp the Changelog
- Replace the `## [Unreleased]` heading with `## [<version>] - <YYYY-MM-DD>` (today's date).
- Insert a new empty `## [Unreleased]` heading above it with standard empty categories ready for the next cycle:
  ```
  ## [Unreleased]

  ### Added

  ### Changed

  ### Fixed

  ### Removed
  ```

### 4. Extract Release Notes
- Read the content under the newly stamped `## [<version>]` heading (everything until the next `##` heading).
- Store it as the release body — this will be posted to GitHub.

### 5. Update Version Numbers
- If `package.json` exists, update the `"version"` field to `<version>`.
- If a version sync script exists (e.g., `pnpm run version:sync` in a monorepo), run it:
  ```bash
  pnpm run version:sync
  ```
- If the project uses a different version file (e.g. `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `version.go`), update it accordingly.

### 6. Check for Duplicate Tag
Before committing, verify the tag does not already exist:
```bash
git tag -l "v<version>"
```
If it returns output, stop and warn the user: "Tag v<version> already exists. Please choose a different version."

### 7. Commit, Tag, and Publish
- Write the release notes to a temp file to avoid shell escaping issues:
  ```bash
  cat > /tmp/release-notes.md << 'EOF'
  <release body>
  EOF
  ```
- Show the user the full plan and ask for approval before running anything:
  ```bash
  git add CHANGELOG.md package.json   # or whichever version file was changed
  git commit -m "chore: release v<version>"
  git tag v<version>
  git push origin HEAD --tags
  gh release create v<version> --title "v<version>" --notes-file /tmp/release-notes.md
  ```
- Wait for the user to approve. Once confirmed, run the commands in order.
- After `gh release create` succeeds, share the GitHub Release URL with the user.
