# Skill: handoff

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- User wants to hand off work to another agent
- Continuing work in a new session
- Passing work to another developer

## Guidelines

Write a handoff document summarizing the current conversation so a fresh agent can continue.

Save to the user's temp directory - not the current workspace.

Include:
- What has been done
- What's remaining
- Key decisions made
- Suggested skills to use

Do not duplicate content already in PRDs, plans, ADRs, issues, or commits. Reference them by path instead.

Redact sensitive info (API keys, passwords, PII).

If user passes arguments describing what next session will focus on, tailor the doc accordingly.
